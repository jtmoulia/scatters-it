# Scatters it

The webapp can be viewed [here](scattersit.herokuapp.com).

This is my first prototype of a simple webapp which is able to plot csv/json
data on a scatter plot. The novelty is making it trivial to set which data
column is plotted along which of the 4 dimensions - X, Y, R, Color, and to
allow the data to be easily updated.

This is built using:

- Coffeescript
- backbone.js
- d3.js
